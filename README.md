This datapack provides seven new encahntments to help you with exploration!

This datapack is mainly to fill a very small niche of mine when I play modded Minecraft. (That niche being simple enchantments).

I've seen several mods and datapacks that add several new encahntments to Minecraft. While they are impressive, these enchantments fall under either one of two nitpicks of mine:

1. Too many enchantments. 
2. Enchantments are useless or overpowered. 

This datapack tries to keep things relatively simple, and only gives enchantments that will be used by everyone who downloads this datapack.

Enchantment List:

**Bless**: Gives the Luck effect, increasing the chances of getting better loot in chests. **Helmet only.**

**Drill**: Gives the Haste effect, making you mine faster.

**Hearty**: Give more hearts to tank any attacks. **Chestplate only.**

**Leap**: Gives the Jump Boost effect, letting you jump higher. **Leggings only.**

**Reach**: Extends the block interaction range, let you mine at longer distances.

**Rush**: Increases attack speed, letting you hit mobs with full charged attacks faster. **Swords only.**

**Sprint**: Gives the Speed effect, making you run faster. **Boots only.**

[Most of the codebase was used from the Bountiful Enchantment mod.](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bountiful-enchantments) Check that out for if you want a datapack/mod with more enchantments to chew on.

New enchantments may be added depending on my free time and user suggestions. Please suggest any new enchantments on the GitHub.

**This datapack is only hosted on CurseForge, Modrinth, Planet Minecraft, and GitHub. Do not download this from other websites.**
